## Validation with Genotypes (Wei et al.)

Of Douglas Fir populations that have been genotypes are only 44 available across the range of its abundance in North America.
This is not enough for a proper validation, but we didn't have a choice but using these few data points.
However, we fitted the SVCM to a large dataset of DF presences. We then predicted with this model to the dataset of 44 true presences and extracted the model coeffienct ("terms"). K-means was applied to get a number of 6 clusters. Those were then compared with the predefined 6 genotypes, a classification contained in the dataset. The similarity we found between classified genotypes and our ecotypic clusters was, quantified with the Rand Index, over 70%.
